In supervised learning, the training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels.  

A typical supervised learning task is classification. The spam filter is a good example of this; it is trained with many example emails along with their class (spam or ham), and it must learn how to classify new emails.

Another typical task is to predict a target numeric value, such as the price of a car, given a seyt of features (mileage, age, brand, ...). This sort of task is called regression. To train the system, you need to give it many examples of cars, including both their features and their targets.
